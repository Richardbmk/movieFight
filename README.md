# Movie Fight with JS ES6

A simple Movie comparison, to see wich movie is better. To do this I use OMDb API. 

##### In this project I focus on:
* To use OMDb API
* Fetch all the data I need from an API and redet in the browser. 
* Reduce and forEach method
* Refactoring and make the code reusable
* Regex
* axios library for access the API
* Use async and await properly
* Host the project on AWS S3 buckets (Github gh-pages, looks like it doesn't support axios library)
